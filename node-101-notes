A node program typically goes like this:
1. define the type of interaction and use the require method to get a var for it
2. create a new server
3. hand the server a function to handle any requests it gets
4. the request will need a 'request' object and it will send back a 'response' obj
5. tell the server to start listening and handling requests at a particular port ('listening on port 8000')
